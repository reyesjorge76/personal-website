Jorge Reyes
created an imaginary restaurant page that hopefully can be fully functional at some point, with experience and learning the necessary techlogolies required for the task.
This project consists of a home page, a menu, events ordering, cart and image collection pages.
used technologies for the project are .html and .css.
Plan to improve on the cart add items, price addition and checkout processes to make it fully functional.
also, maybe some small changes or edits to make it appear more attractive.
